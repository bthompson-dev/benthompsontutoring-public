          Maths is a subject many students think is not for them. Either they
          think they don't have the right brain for it, or they find it boring
          and hard to connect to.
        </p>

        <p>
          I studied Maths up to Higher Level at IB, and it was always a subject
          that I enjoyed, just as much as English and other humanities. If you
          can find ways to enjoy Maths, I believe it becomes a lot easier to
          learn.
        </p>

        <p>
          Often, students who struggle with Maths have fallen slightly behind at
          an earlier stage, and are lacking a full understanding of certain core
          principles. This quickly becomes very discouraging, as they move on to
          harder topics which require that basic foundation to succeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          When tutoring Maths, I always start with the basics, and build up.
          Using games, tasks, challenges and exercises, I aim to make the
          complicated topics seem straightforward.

      <h1>13+</h1>

      <p>
        I enjoy working with 13+ students in Year 8/9, either to prepare for
        entrance exams or simply to build their Maths skills!
      </p>

      <p>
        At this level, the fundamentals are essential - the building blocks of
        algebra, fractions & decimals and geometry. Building full confidence in
        these areas sets up students very well for GCSE.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also like to challenge my students to think laterally, using puzzles
        and tougher questions to stretch their Maths brains.

  <div id="section2">
    <span class="link" id="section2-link"> &nbsp; </span>
    <div id="section2-text">
      <h1>GCSE</h1>

      <p>
        I've helped students at both Foundation and Higher levels with their
        GCSE Maths. Whether they are aiming simply to pass the exam, or to
        achieve the highest grades, I'm happy to offer support.
      </p>

      <p>
        The GCSE syllabus for Maths encompasses a great range of topics, which
        can often be overwhelming for students trying to take it all in. I help
        my students to find the areas they are weaker in, and prioritise topics
        which will bring them the most marks.
      </p>

      <p>
        I always encourage students to think about the concepts involved with
        each topic. If they can see the reasoning behind the methods for
        different problems, I think it allows them to gain a deeper
        understanding overall, which is crucial in adapting to harder questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        I use games and challenges to bring life to the subject even when
        students consider it dull and uninspiring - they are often surprised by
        how much they enjoy it!
