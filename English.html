        <p>
          Having studied English at university, I'm passionate about sharing my
          enthusiasm for the subject.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, English is a critical part of the curriculum, and a
          necessary qualification. But it can also teach key skills that will
          serve students in their other subjects and throughout their lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many students nowadays struggle with the distractions of phones and
          social media. I place a big emphasis on the importance of regular
          reading. Without this, it's very hard for students to learn to
          appreciate subtleties of language, and to express their ideas clearly.
        </p>

        <p>
          I always encourage students to talk about what they're reading outside
          the classroom, and to look for the ways that language is used all
          around them.

      <h1>13+</h1>

      <p>
        I enjoy working with 13+ students in Year 8/9, either to prepare for
        entrance exams or simply to build their reading and writing skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those aiming to enter a secondary school, I can help with exam
        technique and preparation. I'm familiar with the entrance exams for all
        the major London private schools, and recently helped one student gain a
        place at Dulwich College.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also work with students on tasks to practice writing and reading -
        sometimes asking them to write a persuasive task on a given topic, or to
        think about a text and how it's written. I can adapt these sessions to
        pursue students' interests and focus on areas they need to improve.

      <h1>GCSE</h1>

      <p>
        The majority of my tutoring over the last five years has been at GCSE
        level, and so I have a very detailed knowledge of all the major exam
        boards and the texts they cover. I've helped many students to achieve
        A*s/Level 9s, and others to hit and exceed their predicted grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new English GCSEs are challenging exams, especially with the
        requirement to answer off-book for all texts. I help students to focus
        their attention on the areas that matter, building up a foundational
        understanding of the texts and providing key revision material.
      </p>

      <p>
        A particularly important skill that I focus on is close analysis of
        texts and language. Often, students can talk about the overall meaning
        of a text, but struggle to identify how the writer has created that
        meaning. Breaking it down by focusing on specific words and their
        connotations is a simple but incredibly useful technique to learn, for
        both literature and language.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach for each student is always different - I take time to listen
        to them, understand how they think and learn, and teach in a way that
        works for them.

      <h1>A-Level / International Baccalaureate</h1>

      <p>
        I've helped a number of students with their A-Levels and IB English,
        focusing on exam and revision technique as well as assisting with essay
        projects. At this level, lessons are much more discussion-based, and I
        expect students to do more independent work, bringing their own ideas
        and forming subjective interpretations.
      </p>

      <p>
        I greatly enjoy the challenge of exploring more advanced texts and
        pushing students to deepen their analysis. Essay topics I've helped
        students with include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A feminist critique of Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i></li>
        <li>Postcolonial influences on the poetry of Sujata Bhatt</li>
        <li>The use of the narrative voice in Joyce's <i>Dubliners</i></li>
        <li>The struggle for independence in songs by Kendrick Lamar</li>
        <li>
          Gothic literature and the taboo in <i>Frankenstein</i> &
          <i>The Bloody Chamber</i>
        </li>

      <h1>English as a foreign language</h1>

      <p>
        I've taught English as a foreign language across the world, to a huge
        variety of students. I really enjoy helping students to learn the
        language, and it greatly informs my tutoring style across all subjects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with the Speakout textbooks, but like to use a variety of
        exercises, games, discussion, and other tasks to engage students and
        develop their speaking, writing and grammar skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've taught students from Beginner level up to Advanced, and always
        adapt my teaching and materials to challenge but not overwhelm.
