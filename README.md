# Ben Thompson Tutoring

This is a website built to advertise a tutoring business. The live website can be viewed at: www.benthompsontutoring.co.uk

It was created with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, with a small amount of PHP to add a simple email form.

Responsive for mobile layouts, and optimized for SEO.

This was my first attempt at putting a website together - so there are some aspects of the code which could be better structured. In particular, the CSS, which was organised without using Sass or BEM notation.
If I was to make this website again from scratch, I would also want to use a static site generator like 11ty, to make development easier with a template system.
