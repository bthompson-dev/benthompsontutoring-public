            "My teenage son has been very negative towards having a tutor so I
            took my time to find someone I thought would be a good fit. I didn't
            need to worry, from the first meet I could tell that my son was
            going to be happy. Ben understood what we wanted out of the lessons
            and also got my son on board. Upon asking my son's opinion after the
            first session, he said the lesson was 'good' and he told me what he
            had taken on board. From a reluctant student that is the highest
            praise! I'm so relieved and pleased."

            "Ben tutored my daughter in both English Literature and Language. A
            few weeks after she started her lessons with him, her results and
            confidence in English have raised. Unfortunately she was preparing
            for her GCSE when Coronavirus happened. Then, Ben has been very
            adaptable and patient considering the situation, switching to
            on-line lessons, starting preparing her for the next step and trying
            to motivate her hence the very difficult situation. I am extremely
            grateful for Ben's commitment. "

            "Ben helped my son achieve a 9. He went from low confidence to the
            top score with Ben’s gentle guidance. He really enjoyed Ben’s
            company and never resented the lessons."

            "Ben is an exceptional English tutor – professional and friendly!
            When I began getting tutored for English Language, I lacked passion
            for the subject, and always struggled with it. I had plenty of other
            tutors in the space of 2 years, while still seeing no improvement in
            my grades. However, not long after Ben started teaching me, I saw my
            confidence build up drastically. The lessons were always
            informative, incredibly engaging, and very useful. I actually found
            myself enjoying the subject, which reflected in my grades. Even
            after we transitioned to remote tuition, the quality of Ben’s
            teaching remained the same. I managed to go from 4s and 5s in
            English Language to an 8 in my final GCSE exam! I urge anyone
            looking for an English tutor to contact Ben!"

            "Ben has been tutoring my son through his GCSE English Literature
            for the last 3+ years. Ben has been amazing and I can’t recommend
            him highly enough. My son looked forward to his sessions with Ben,
            which were always thoroughly prepared and well thought through. He
            gave my son the confidence to go into his exam knowing that he knew
            how to approach the questions which is invaluable. Thank you Ben!"

            "My 15 year old son has been having weekly alternate maths and
            English tutor sessions with Ben since late 2019. We have found his
            help invaluable in both subjects. Our son finds him ready easy to
            get along with and really appreciates the confidence this gives him
            as he moves towards this years GCSE exams."

            well as Maths at GCSE level. He is an enthusiastic, hard working and
            supportive tutor who helped my daughter achieve 2 A*'s in English
            and a 5 in Maths. She had a very negative attitude towards Maths in
            general and was at a grade 2 at the beginning of the year. However,
            with the hard work and dedication from Ben she was able to pass."

            and Ben has made a huge difference, as noted by his English teachers
            at school. Ben is conscientious, explains themes and ideas clearly
            and well is patient and punctual. Even more importantly my son has
            enjoyed the lessons. Highly recommended."

            "At the start of year 11 my son was predicted a 6 and a 7 in English
            Language and Literature. After contacting Ben and arranging weekly
            sessions he helped my son with the parts he found difficult and
            increased his confidence in English. My son along with the help of
            Ben managed to achieve two grade 9s. He was very kind and polite,
            and I definitely recommend him for GCSE English."

            "Ben is an excellent tutor. He tutors both my son (GCSE English
            Language & Literature) and daughter (13+ Entrance Exams). He’s
            always well prepared and knows how to engage to get the best out of
            them during those sessions. We’ve been using Ben for just a couple
            of months now and can already see an improvement in my son’s
            performance. He’s a lot more confident in understanding the content,
            exam technique and knows what is needed to get maximum points. Ben
            also gives detailed feedback after each lesson which is hugely
            helpful to me as a parent. It’s only been a few weeks for our
            daughter but she comes away much more confident in how to approach
            comprehensions (past papers) and is starting to improve her creative
            writing style."

            "Ben has tutored both my sons in Maths and English over the past few
            years and I can’t overstate how grateful I am for his help. He’s a
            legend! Without him, my sons would never have achieved the grades
            they did. Ben is patient and calm, painstakingly careful to get the
            detail right, always so encouraging and positive and he makes his
            lessons engaging. I think he is an exceptional tutor and I have no
            hesitation in recommending him wholeheartedly."
